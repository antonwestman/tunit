# Rtest

`rtest` is my take on building a testing framework, it's heavily influenced by
[minitest](https://github.com/seattlerb/minitest).

I wanted to see how much code and effort is needed to build a testing framework
of my own. This is the outcome of it

_NOTE_ This is very unstable and is just a playground for my ideas.
